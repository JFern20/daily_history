# DailyHistory

This project called Daily History will provide a quick glance into the history of the current day. I used https://www.timeanddate.com/on-this-day/ to scrape the data from. The CLI would greet you with:

" What Happened On This day - Current Date " 

And will list a short list of historical headlines in numeric order.

The user will then be able to choose a headline to read more about by selecting the number of the headline of their interest. Once the number of the headline is selected the user will get a brief summary of the chosen headline.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daily_history'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install daily_history

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
